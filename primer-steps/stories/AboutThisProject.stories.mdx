## About

A stepped workflow component implemented in React, inspired by [this Chakra UI Steps project](https://jeanverster.github.io/chakra-ui-steps-site/) by Jean Verster, but with Chakra UI completely removed.

To achieve a visual design, I used [Github Primer](https://primer.style/) primitives and tokens, but any design system could be used to achieve consistent visual patterns to support the same interaction patterns.
